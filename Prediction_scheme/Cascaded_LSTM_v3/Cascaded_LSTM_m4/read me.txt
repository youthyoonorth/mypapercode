1. Enter ''python train_icc4.py'' for training the model;
   Enter ''python test_icc4.py'' for testing the model.

Note: the trained models can be downloaded from the link https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/e3b3793cb4ed4950be66/.

2. File function:
train_icc4: the main program for model training and validation;
test_icc4: the main program for model testing;
model_icc: deep learning model;

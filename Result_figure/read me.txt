result: \tau = {0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9} for both training and evaluation sets.
result_v2: \tau = {0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9} for evaluation set, while \tau is randomly generated for training set.
result_v3 (final version): \tau =  {0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.99} for evaluation set, while \tau is randomly generated for training set.
